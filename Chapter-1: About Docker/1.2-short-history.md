# Short History

### Docker's Origins:

Solomon Hykes conceptualized Docker at dotCloud to address challenges in deploying and managing applications in the cloud. The idea was to create a platform-agnostic solution that could package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Early Technology and Popularity:

Initially, Docker leveraged LXC, a Linux containerization technology, as its default execution environment. This choice allowed Docker to efficiently isolate processes and create lightweight containers. The approach quickly gained traction in the development community due to its speed, resource efficiency, and the ability to run consistent environments across various systems.

### Open Source Move:

Docker's decision to open-source its technology marked a pivotal moment in its development. By making the source code freely available, Docker encouraged collaboration, transparency, and community contributions. This move contributed significantly to Docker's widespread adoption, turning it into a flagship project on GitHub, where developers from around the world could contribute to its improvement.
<br>

### Technical Details:

Docker is written in the Go programming language (often referred to as Golang). The choice of Go aligns with Docker's emphasis on performance, efficiency, and scalability. Go's concurrency model and straightforward syntax make it well-suited for building robust, concurrent systems â€“ a crucial aspect for managing and orchestrating containers efficiently within the Docker ecosystem. The use of Go also facilitates Docker's cross-platform compatibility.
