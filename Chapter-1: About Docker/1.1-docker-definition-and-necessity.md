# What is Docker and Why We Need Docker?

### What is Docker?

Let's imagine we're building a virtual world on our computer, like a sandbox where we can create and run different programs. Or, let's assume we need to create and run different programs in our virtual world. Each program comes with its own set of rules and requirements. Now, sometimes these programs might need specific settings or resources to run properly, and managing them can be a bit tricky.

Here's where Docker comes in. Docker is like a magical container ship for your programs. It packages everything a program needs – its code, libraries, and settings – into a container. This container is consistent and works the same way on any computer that has Docker installed. It's like a standardized package that you can easily move around, share, and run on different machines.

Imagine you're a software developer working on a web application. Your application uses a specific programming language, relies on certain libraries or frameworks, and interacts with a database. Now, you want to share this application with your team members, and they need to run it on their machines to collaborate effectively.

Let's take a look at the next section to understand more about docker and why we need this.

### Why We Need Docker?

Without Docker, they would have to install the same programming language, set up the exact libraries and dependencies, configure the database, and make sure everything matches your development environment. This process can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Beside this, your team members simply need to download and run the Docker container on their machines. The container ensures that your application runs in an isolated environment, avoiding conflicts with other applications or variations in their individual development setups.

Let's say you've cooked multiple dishes and you need to transport them in a big box to your grandmother's house. If you put all the dishes in the same box, they will get mixed up and lose their individual flavors. Therefore, it's better to use a container system. You can use small containers or boxes to separate different dishes and place them into their respective containers. Finally, place all the containers or boxes into the big box. This way, the dishes won't mix and will retain their distinct flavors.
Similarly, Docker creates an isolated environment for an application so that the base operating system of your laptop or computer will not be affected.

If we summerize the the scenarios then we may come to the following points:

**Consistency**: Docker ensures that a program runs the same way on different computers, avoiding the "it works on my machine" problem.

**Isolation**: Each program runs in its own container, like a separate box. This prevents one program from messing with another, and it keeps everything neat and tidy.

**Efficiency**: Docker containers share the resources of your computer, making them lightweight and efficient. You can run multiple containers on the same machine without conflicts.

**Portability**: You can easily move Docker containers between different environments – from your laptop to a server, or even to a cloud platform. This makes deploying and scaling applications much simpler.
